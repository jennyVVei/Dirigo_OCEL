# _Dirigo_: A Method to Generate Event Logs for Object-Centric Processes

This is the supplementary repository for the paper Dirigo: A Method to Generate Event Logs for Object-Centric Processes. In this paper, we address existing research gaps by proposing a novel method, namely Dirigo, to generate event logs for object-centric processes. We employ object-role modelling (ORM), a conceptual data modelling technique, to precisely capture the required data structure in OCEL. To validate the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to a real-life use case and generate a simulated event log using the Coloured Petri net. We also propose a set of assessment criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated event log against existing OCEL-compliant event log representations.

This repository includes three sections:

1. CPN models
2. The generated OCEL log for the cargo pickup process
3. Data queries for proposed quality criteria for demonstrating evaluation results.
